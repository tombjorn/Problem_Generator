# Problem_Generator
Generates a Problem_File.py with a random prompt for an array or string based problem, accompanied by corresponding data type.

Run Problem_Gen.py and Problem_File.py will be opened in same folder, can change the location of Problem_File.py with path argument.

Simple but pretty pleased with this little project!
  - Could add more problem types down the road; recursion, 2D arrays and nested dictionaries could be cool.
  - Would be nice to create a bot that checks the code?
